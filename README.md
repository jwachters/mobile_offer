# General

To build this web application I've chosen for Sinatra, because it is a simple web application with only 1 page.
Rails could be an option too, but it would be too much.

To test the application I use Capybara and Test::Unit, because it makes it easy to make integration tests and interact with forms.

# Installation

1. Install all necessary gems
> $ bundle install

2. Start the web server
> $ rackup

# Tests

Run the rake task in the root path
> $ rake test
