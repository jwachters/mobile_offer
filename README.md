# General

Sinatra is chosen, because this app is a simple web application with only 1 or 2 pages.
Rails could be an option too, but it would be too much.

# Installation

1. Install all necessary gems
> $ bundle install

2. Start the web server
> $ rackup

# Tests

Run the rake task in the root path
> $ rake test
